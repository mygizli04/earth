//For the moon to function, we have to make sure the sun is always working. It's kinda hard to make a superplanet that won't crash the whole universe. Beacuse unless someone happens to backup the whole dynamic universe we might have to start over.


//Temporary
trait Sun {
    var state: Burning;
    var IsHot: 1;
    var SpreadsLight: 1;
}

//TODO: Fix the damn thing, duh!
//TODO: Find out why some AI don't detect "light"
